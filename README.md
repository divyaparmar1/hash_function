# Hash Function Implementation

The Hash Function Implementation project is a cybersecurity project that implements various hash functions for generating hash codes from input data. This project provides a user-friendly interface for users to input data and select different hash algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256) to generate hash codes.

## Features

- **Multiple Hash Algorithms:** Implements popular hash algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.
- **Hash Code Generation:** Allows users to input data and generate hash codes using the selected hash algorithm.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for inputting data and selecting hash algorithms.
- **Instant Feedback:** The application instantly displays the generated hash code based on user input.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python (and any required libraries) installed.
3. Run the `hash_function.py` script.
4. Enter the data you want to hash.
5. Choose a hash algorithm (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256).
6. Observe the generated hash code.
